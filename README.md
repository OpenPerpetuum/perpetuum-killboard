# OpenPerpetuum Killboard

A [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) app utilizing [Bulma.css](https://bulma.io/) framework to display information about the kill events happening in [OpenPerpetuum](https://openperpetuum.com/)!


## Get started
**Requirements**
You need to install the following
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) => Get either 14.16.0 LTS or Current version, it shouldn't matter
- Text Editor of choice => [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) etc
- (Optional) [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  => If you want to contribute changes and submit them as a Pull Requests


**How to  develop**
`git clone` the project repository. Alternatively download the .zip and extract it.
Open a terminal and navigate to the folder you cloned/extracted the repository to.
Run `npm install` to get all the dependencies of the project. (First time only)

Now run `npm start` to run the app locally :rocket:
It will open a browser which will direct you to the app, and every time you save changes in your text editor it will update live. 

*Note: The repository does not contain the image resources, so locally you will not see robot-icons.*
